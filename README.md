## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

```plaintext
REACT_APP_NEWS_API_KEY=bae87c3b6dd341f78eb12b9a3dde9796
REACT_APP_GUARDIAN_API_KEY=407e5494-8766-4d8a-b09b-9338d3195ca0
REACT_APP_NYTIMES_API_KEY=1KMqYt8HzovjfyAg0qjygL1BIkuxCfuq
```

Replace `your_newsapi_key_here`, `your_guardian_api_key_here`, and `your_ny_times_api_key_here` with your actual API keys.

## Troubleshooting

- **401 Unauthorized Error**: Ensure that your API keys are correctly set in the `.env` file and that the environment variables are correctly loaded.
- **No Articles Found**: Verify that the API endpoints are correct and that the query parameters match the expected format. Ensure that the APIs are returning data for the given query.
